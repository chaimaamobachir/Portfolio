# Chaimaa Moubachir — Portfolio

This repository contains a personal portfolio site built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases projects in medical imaging, web & mobile applications, and data visualization.

Files of interest
- `index.html` — main page
- `style.css` — (optional) external stylesheet
- `script.js` — (optional) external JS

How to view
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.

Notes
- Some assets (images/videos) are stored in `assets/`.
- This README was created because `git add README.md` previously failed — the file did not exist.
